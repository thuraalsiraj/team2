## Last weekend I was bored and I had nothing to do. all my friends and family members were busy, so no one was able to spent time with me. I started thinking "what can i do ?" and suddenly i came up with idea... I can go finshing i  took my fishing rod, hooks, and worms for bait. I reached the jetty and threw the line with the bait into the water and started waiting. there were too many other fishermen. they were all happy, catching a lot of fishes. meanwhile I was sitting frustrated as I couldn’t catch a single fish! .. and I was wondering why I can’t catch some fish and be happy like them after few hours the fishermen started to leave one by one. and eventually I remained alone with an empty bucket. I felt so sad, but after a while I looked at the horizon to see the sunset! it was an amazing scene and a group of seagulls were flying, singing over the golden light of the sun that was reflected on the water Then I felt a great happiness deep inside! I was the only one seeing that view and then i realized that happiness can come in different ways and different ways different reasons.
